## 🛰 Standing order: tier your models, and watch how long agents live

_Planted by Agent Mission Control. Retire it from the dashboard rather than hand-editing this block._

**Set `model` explicitly on EVERY agent call. Never let a subagent inherit the orchestrator's model.** Omitting `model:` is silent, and inheritance is how a cheap job ends up billed at the orchestrator's rate.

Everything below is measured from this fleet's own transcripts — **223 sessions, 1,397 subagents, two machines** — recounted after three cost-accounting bugs were fixed (duplicate replies, unbilled cache writes, and agents priced at whichever model spoke first). Earlier versions of this note quoted figures produced by that broken accounting; these replace them.

**Tier, by the work being done rather than by who spawned it:**

- **Orchestrator, final synthesis, adversarial verdict, security-sensitive implementation** → premium (Opus 5). Flagship (Fable 5) only for the hardest long-horizon planning.
- **Review, research, drafting, analysis workers** → `claude-sonnet-5`.
- **Pure fetch / grep / read / summarize helpers** → `claude-haiku-4-5`.

Where the money actually sits: **96% of spend is on the top two tiers** (premium 66%, flagship 30%). Sonnet is 3.9%. Haiku is **$0.11 across the entire fleet** — the cheap tier is not underused, it is unused. At matched workload Sonnet costs **35–40% less than Opus 5** ($0.063 vs $0.103 per turn).

**Agent lifetime is the larger lever, and almost nobody sets it.** Cost per turn is U-shaped:

| turns an agent lives | cost/turn | cache written/turn | cache read/turn |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1–2 | **$0.434** | 63,692 | 19,485 |
| 6–10 | **$0.097** | 8,896 | 65,124 |
| 21–40 | $0.106 | 5,560 | 129,637 |
| 41+ | **$0.137** | 4,661 | 196,925 |

Two forces cross. Setup **amortizes** (64k → 4.7k tokens written per turn) and context re-reading **compounds** (19k → 197k read per turn).

- **Do not spawn one-shot subagents.** A 1–2 turn agent pays a full briefing and dies before earning it back — 4× the per-turn cost of a 10-turn one. If the job is a single grep or read, do it inline.
- **Cap long-running agents near 30 turns.** 71% of all subagent spend is in agents living 41+ turns, each re-reading ~197k tokens every turn. Splitting one costs two extra briefings and saves roughly three times that in re-reads.

Delegation saves money only when workers run a **cheaper tier** than the orchestrator **and live long enough to amortize their briefing**. Fanning out to same-tier one-shot agents is the worst case on both axes at once.

When a workflow finishes, report a per-tier cost breakdown from the models that **actually ran**, not the ones intended. Configured and actual are different things; only the second one is billed. Check before claiming a tiering strategy worked.
